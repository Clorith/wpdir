### Getting help using WPdir

If you have a question about using WPdir, you can create an issue here or ask me on the WordPress Slack `@peterbooker`.

### Reporting bugs

Like every software, WPdir has its flaws. If you find one, [search the issues](https://github.com/wpdirectory/wpdir/issues) to see if it has already been reported. If not, [open a new issue](https://github.com/wpdirectory/wpdir/issues/new) and describe the bug, and somebody will look into it!

We know most in the WordPress community will be unfamiliar with Go, there is no pressure to identify the code causing problems. Any information you can provide will help identify and fix the problem quickly.

We suggest reading [How to Report Bugs Effectively](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html).

### Suggesting features

Feature suggestions are a valuable way to contribute and provide feedback. It helps discussions if you can explain the use case fully, helping to communicate how and why the feature will be useful.

### Contributing code

You can have a direct impact on the project by helping with its code. To contribute code to WPdir, open a [pull request](https://github.com/wpdirectory/wpdir/pulls) (PR). If you're new to our community, that's okay: **we gladly welcome pull requests from anyone, regardless of your native language or coding experience.**

#### HOW TO MAKE A PULL REQUEST TO WPDIRECTORY

Contributing to Go projects on GitHub is fun and easy. We recommend the following workflow:

1. [Fork this repo](https://github.com/wpdirectory/wpdir). This makes a copy of the code you can write to.

2. If you don't already have this repo (wpdirectory/wpdir.git) repo on your computer, get it with `go get github.com/wpdirectory/wpdir`.

3. Tell git that it can push the `wpdirectory/wpdir.git` repo to your fork by adding a remote: `git remote add myfork https://github.com/you/wpdir.git`

4. Make your changes in the `wpdirectory/wpdir.git` repo on your computer.

5. Push your changes to your fork: `git push myfork`

6. [Create a pull request](https://github.com/wpdirectory/wpdir/pull/new/master) to merge your changes into wpdirectory/wpdir @ master. (Click "compare across forks" and change the head fork.)

This workflow is nice because you don't have to change import paths. You can get fancier by using different branches if you want.

## Thank you

Thanks for your help! WPDirectory is nothing without the WordPress community.
