# mtStats

The mtStats website is built with a server written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and a [React](https://reactjs.org/) based frontend found in the `web` folder.

The API returns a broad variety of data on MMA- Fighters, Fights, Events, Organisations, Teams, etc. It also provides fantasy betting features.

## Early Development

The project has only just started, so what is here is likely to be unfinished or buggy for the coming weeks. I will update this readme once the website is live.
